# PYTHON_DICTIONARY
A simple dictionary created using python
It has 2 files --> data.json(the data for dictionary in json format) & code.py(python code)
It has a command line interface(no GUI) 
so either go to terminal or command prompt or powershell to run this
use cd(change directory command) to reach to the path where you have downloaded folder
cd.. moves back to one directory while cd {foldername} moves to the next directory
now using the commands in terminal when you visit the pyDict folder then type python code.py to execute and see the results
